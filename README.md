## Project Overview
ChatProfit is a startup platform designed to bridge the gap between WhatsApp group owners and advertisers interested in promoting products to niche audiences. The platform aims to empower group owners to monetize their communities while providing advertisers with access to highly engaged, targeted groups aligned with their products or services.
The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of user preferences, ad engagement behaviors, and monetization potential within WhatsApp groups. By leveraging structured survey data from group members, admins, and advertisers, we aim to:
- Understand the motivations and preferences of each user segment.
- Identify optimal ad formats and placements that enhance engagement without disrupting the group experience.
- Develop insights to inform feature development for ChatProfit, ensuring it meets the needs of group owners, members, and advertisers alike.

## Features

- Monetization Tools: Offer options for admins to generate revenue through targeted ads and promotions.
- Ad Placement Control: Allow for non-intrusive ad placements to maintain a positive user experience.
- Advertiser Dashboard: Enable advertisers to track ad performance and reach targeted demographics

  Members prefer ads that are non-intrusive and fit naturally within group discussions.
  Video ads were noted as disruptive, while text/image formats were viewed as more acceptable.

- Willingness to Interact with Ads:
  Relevant ads generate high engagement, but concerns about “ad fatigue” suggest the need for moderation in ad frequency.
